  "your_service_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "your_service_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    your_service_msgsConfig.cmake
    your_service_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "your_service_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "your_service_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "your_service_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
